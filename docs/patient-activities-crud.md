Estas vistas son plantillas Blade que se utilizan para mostrar formularios y listas de actividades de pacientes.

- **edit.blade.php**: Formulario para editar una actividad de paciente.
- **show.blade.php**: Muestra los detalles de una actividad de paciente.
- **create.blade.php**: Formulario para crear una nueva actividad de paciente.
- **index.blade.php**: Lista de actividades de pacientes con opciones para ver, editar y eliminar.

### Conceptos Relevantes

- **Form Requests**: Clases que encapsulan la lógica de validación y autorización de solicitudes HTTP.
- **Eloquent ORM**: Proporciona una forma sencilla y elegante de interactuar con la base de datos.
- **Blade Templates**: Sistema de plantillas de Laravel que permite crear vistas reutilizables y organizadas.
- **Migraciones**: Permiten definir y modificar la estructura de la base de datos de manera controlada y versionada.

Estos cambios y conceptos son fundamentales para entender cómo Laravel maneja las solicitudes HTTP, la validación de datos, las relaciones entre modelos y la generación de vistas dinámicas.
